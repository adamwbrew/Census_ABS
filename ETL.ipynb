    "The US Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (ABS) gathers demographic and economic information about businesses and business owners. There are four main ABS datasets aggregated by the Census Bureau and made available to the public via an API We will be looking at the 2019 survey results. According to the Census Bureau:<br>\n",
    "\"**Company Summary** provides data for employer businesses by sector, sex, ethnicity, race, veteran status, years in business, receipts size of firm, and employment size of firm for the U.S., states, and metro areas. \"<br>\n",
    "\"**Characteristics of Businesses** provides data for respondent employer firms by sector, sex, ethnicity, race, veteran status, years in business, receipts size of firm, and employment size of firm for the U.S., states, and metro areas, including detailed business characteristics.\"<br>\n",
    "\"**Characteristics of Business Owners** provides data for owners of respondent employer firms by sector, sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for the U.S., states, and metro areas, including detailed owner characteristics.\"<br>\n",
    "\"**Technology Characteristics of Businesses** provides data on technology use and production for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud-Based Computing, Specialized Software, Robotics, and Specialized Equipment technologies data at the U.S and State level for 2018.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at data at the state level, we wanted to normalize the data by population. We pulled in another CSV from the Census Bureau that Contained population data for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create map visualizations, we also needed to pull in a CSV that contained state names and abbreviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data sets need to be transformed in order to make meaningful visualizations. \n",
